# Unused Code Checklist

This document identifies potential unused or redundant code that could be removed to improve codebase maintainability and performance.

## üîç Areas to Investigate

### Components

1. **Potential Unused Components**
   - Check if all components in `/src/components/ui` are actually being used
   - Verify that all exported components from index files are imported elsewhere

2. **Dead Code in Large Components**
   - Check `UserProfile.tsx` and `UserBookings.tsx` for unused methods or state
   - Review conditional rendering blocks that might never be reached

### Hooks and Utils

1. **Potential Unused Hooks**
   - Review all custom hooks to ensure they're being used
   - Check for duplicate functionality across multiple hooks

2. **Unused Utility Functions**
   - Analyze utility functions for usage across the application
   - Look for deprecated or replaced utility functions

### Styles and Assets

1. **Unused CSS**
   - Identify unused Tailwind classes
   - Look for CSS overrides that aren't taking effect

2. **Unused Media**
   - Check for unused images or icons
   - Review font imports for unused weights or styles

## üßπ Cleanup Procedure

### Dead Code Elimination

1. **Use Tools to Identify Unused Code**
   - Configure ESLint with unused-imports plugin
   - Use `depcheck` to find unused dependencies

2. **Safely Remove Code**
   - Use feature flags before permanent removal
   - Document removed code in changelog

### Code Consolidation

1. **Merge Similar Functions**
   - Identify and combine functions with similar purposes
   - Create more generic versions of specific utility functions

2. **Standardize Patterns**
   - Standardize form handling
   - Consolidate API calling patterns

## üìã Redundant Logic Checklist

- [ ] Check for repeated fetch logic that could be consolidated
- [ ] Review transformation functions that could be generalized
- [ ] Identify duplicate validation logic across forms
- [ ] Look for repeated UI patterns that could be componentized

## üöÄ Expected Benefits

- Reduced bundle size
- Improved maintainability
- Better code readability
- Faster build times
- Simplified onboarding for new developers
