## Project Timeline Summary

**Total Duration:** 12 weeks
**Team Size:** 3-4 developers + 1 QA (final stage)
**Key Milestones:**
- Week 2: Development environment and authentication ready
- Week 6: MVP with core project and task management
- Week 10: Full-featured application with real-time collaboration
- Week 12: Production-ready application with comprehensive testing

**Budget Considerations:**
- Development team: 12 weeks Ã— 4 developers
- Third-party services: Auth0, AWS S3, deployment platforms
- Testing and QA: 2 weeks dedicated QA resources
- Infrastructure and hosting costs

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Start with Auth0 integration early to avoid authentication delays
- Implement Socket.io in Stage 3 to allow fallback if real-time features are complex
- Plan for additional testing time if complex integrations require more work
- Consider phased rollout for file management features if S3 integration proves challenging
