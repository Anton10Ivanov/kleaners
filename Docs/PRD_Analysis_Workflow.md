# PRD Analysis Workflow Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a step-by-step workflow for analyzing Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and generating comprehensive implementation plans using the PRD Implementation Plan Generator system.

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Initial PRD Analysis

#### Step 1: Document Review and Preparation
```markdown
## Pre-Analysis Checklist
- [ ] Receive and review the complete PRD document
- [ ] Identify document structure and sections
- [ ] Note any missing information or unclear requirements
- [ ] Prepare workspace and documentation templates
- [ ] Set up research tools and bookmarks
```

#### Step 2: Comprehensive PRD Reading
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes
**Objective**: Gain complete understanding of the product vision and requirements

**Actions**:
1. **First Read**: Complete document scan for overall understanding
2. **Second Read**: Detailed analysis with note-taking
3. **Third Read**: Feature extraction and categorization

**Key Focus Areas**:
- Product vision and goals
- Target audience and user personas
- Core functionality requirements
- Technical constraints and requirements
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Timeline and budget constraints
- Integration requirements
- Compliance and security needs

#### Step 3: Feature Extraction and Documentation
**Duration**: 45-90 minutes
**Objective**: Create comprehensive feature inventory

**Process**:
1. **Extract All Features**: List every feature mentioned in the PRD
2. **Group Related Features**: Organize by functional area
3. **Identify Dependencies**: Note feature interdependencies
4. **Estimate Complexity**: Assign complexity levels (Low/Medium/High)

**Template**:
```markdown
## Feature Inventory
### Authentication & User Management
- [ ] User registration - Medium complexity
- [ ] User login/logout - Low complexity  
- [ ] Password reset - Medium complexity
- [ ] Profile management - Medium complexity

### Core Functionality
- [ ] [Feature name] - [Complexity level]
- [ ] [Feature name] - [Complexity level]

### Integration Features
- [ ] [Integration name] - [Complexity level]
- [ ] [Integration name] - [Complexity level]
```

### Phase 2: Technology Research and Selection

#### Step 4: Technology Stack Research
**Duration**: 60-120 minutes
**Objective**: Identify optimal technology stack for the project

**Research Process**:
1. **Analyze Requirements**: Match tech needs to PRD requirements
2. **Web Search for Current Best Practices**: Research latest recommendations
3. **Compare Alternatives**: Evaluate multiple options
4. **Validate Choices**: Check community support and documentation

**Web Search Strategy**:
```markdown
## Search Queries Template

- "[Year] best frontend framework for [project type]"
- "[Framework name] vs [alternative] comparison [year]"
- "[Framework name] official documentation"
- "[Framework name] performance benchmarks"

### Backend Framework Research  
- "[Year] best backend framework [language]"
- "[Framework name] scalability best practices"
- "[Framework name] security considerations"
- "[Framework name] deployment options"

### Database Research
- "[Year] database comparison [SQL/NoSQL]"
- "[Database name] performance characteristics"
- "[Database name] scaling strategies"
- "[Database name] backup and recovery"
```

#### Step 5: Technology Documentation and Justification
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**Objective**: Document technology choices with clear justifications

**Documentation Template**:
```markdown
## Technology Stack Decision Matrix

### Frontend Framework: [Selected Technology]
**Justification**:
