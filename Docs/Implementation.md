## Research Guidelines

### Technology Research Checklist
- [ ] Check official documentation and community support
- [ ] Verify current version stability and update frequency
- [ ] Research learning curve and team expertise requirements
- [ ] Evaluate performance benchmarks and scalability
- [ ] Check integration capabilities with other tools
- [ ] Review security considerations and best practices
- [ ] Assess long-term maintenance and support

### Web Search Strategy
1. **Current Best Practices**: Search for "[Technology] best practices 2024"
2. **Official Documentation**: Always include official docs links
3. **Community Resources**: Include Stack Overflow, GitHub, and community guides
4. **Comparison Articles**: Research technology comparisons and alternatives
5. **Tutorial Resources**: Find quality learning resources for the team

## Quality Standards

### Time Estimation Guidelines
- **Small Feature**: 1-3 days
- **Medium Feature**: 1-2 weeks
- **Large Feature**: 2-4 weeks
- **Complex Integration**: 1-3 weeks
- **Testing Phase**: 20-30% of development time
- **Polish Phase**: 15-25% of total project time

### Task Granularity Rules
- Each checkbox should represent 4-16 hours of work
- Tasks should be specific enough to track progress
- Avoid micro-tasks that clutter the plan
- Focus on deliverable outcomes
- Include testing as part of each major task

### Documentation Requirements
- All major technologies must have official documentation links
- Include both quick-start and comprehensive documentation
- Provide learning resources for team skill development
- Link to best practices and style guides
- Include troubleshooting and FAQ resources
