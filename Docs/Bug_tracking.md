## Common Issues and Solutions

### Setup and Configuration Issues

#### Issue: Development Environment Setup
**Common Problems:**
- Node version compatibility
- Package installation failures
- Environment variable configuration
- Database connection issues

**Solutions:**
- Use Node Version Manager (nvm) for consistent Node versions
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Check `.env.example` for required environment variables
- Verify database credentials and connection strings

#### Issue: Build and Compilation Errors
**Common Problems:**
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Missing dependencies
- Path resolution issues
- Asset loading failures

**Solutions:**
- Check TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Use absolute imports with path mapping
- Ensure assets are in correct directories

### Frontend Development Issues

#### Issue: React Component Errors
**Common Problems:**
- Hook dependency warnings
- State update on unmounted components
- Key prop warnings in lists
- Context provider issues

**Solutions:**
- Include all dependencies in useEffect dependency arrays
- Use cleanup functions and abort controllers
- Always provide unique keys for list items
- Wrap components with proper context providers

#### Issue: Styling and Layout Problems
**Common Problems:**
- CSS class conflicts
- Responsive design issues
- Z-index stacking problems
- Animation performance

**Solutions:**
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for scoping
- Test on multiple screen sizes and devices
- Use CSS custom properties for z-index management
- Use transform and opacity for performant animations

### Backend Development Issues

#### Issue: API and Database Errors
**Common Problems:**
- CORS configuration issues
- Authentication middleware failures
- Database query optimization
- File upload handling

**Solutions:**
- Configure CORS properly for development and production
- Implement proper error handling in auth middleware
- Use database indexes and query optimization
- Validate file types and sizes before upload

#### Issue: Security and Authentication
**Common Problems:**
- JWT token validation
- Password hashing issues
- Rate limiting configuration
- Input validation failures

**Solutions:**
- Use proper JWT libraries and validation
- Use bcrypt for password hashing with appropriate salt rounds
- Implement rate limiting with express-rate-limit
- Use validation libraries like Joi or express-validator

### Deployment and Production Issues

#### Issue: Build and Deployment Failures
**Common Problems:**
- Environment variable mismatches
- Build optimization issues
- Static file serving
- Database migration problems

**Solutions:**
- Maintain consistent environment variables across environments
- Configure build tools for production optimization
- Set up proper static file serving with correct headers
- Test database migrations in staging environment first

## Error Categories

### Critical Errors

## Debugging Strategies

### Frontend Debugging
1. **Browser Developer Tools**
   - Use React Developer Tools extension
   - Monitor Network tab for API calls
   - Check Console for JavaScript errors
   - Use Performance tab for optimization

2. **Code Debugging**
   - Add strategic console.log statements
   - Use debugger statements for breakpoints
   - Implement error boundaries for React
   - Use TypeScript for compile-time error detection

### Backend Debugging
1. **Server Logging**
   - Implement structured logging with Winston or similar
   - Log request/response cycles
   - Monitor database queries
   - Track authentication events

2. **Database Debugging**
   - Use query logging in development
   - Monitor slow query logs
   - Check database indexes
   - Validate data integrity

### Integration Debugging
1. **API Testing**
   - Use Postman or similar tools for API testing
   - Implement automated API tests
   - Monitor third-party service responses
   - Check webhook deliveries

2. **Cross-browser Testing**
   - Test on multiple browsers and versions
   - Use browser compatibility tools
   - Check responsive design on various devices
   - Validate accessibility compliance

## Prevention Strategies

### Code Quality
- Implement ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Write unit tests for critical functions
- Conduct code reviews before merging

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for optimization

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Implement error tracking with Sentry or similar
- Set up performance monitoring
- Monitor server resources and database performance
- Create alerts for critical system metrics

### Documentation
- Keep documentation up to date
- Document known issues and workarounds
- Maintain troubleshooting guides
- Create runbooks for common procedures

## Bug Tracking Workflow

### 1. Bug Discovery
- Document the bug immediately when discovered
- Assign appropriate severity and priority
- Add to development backlog or current sprint

### 2. Investigation
- Reproduce the bug in development environment
- Analyze root cause
- Estimate fix complexity and time required

### 3. Resolution
- Implement fix following coding standards
- Test fix thoroughly
- Update documentation if necessary

### 4. Verification
- Verify fix resolves the original issue
- Check for regression in related functionality
- Update bug status and close if resolved

### 5. Post-Resolution
- Document lessons learned
- Update prevention strategies
- Share knowledge with team members
