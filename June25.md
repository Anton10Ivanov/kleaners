# Project Optimization Analysis - June 25th

## Executive Summary
After analyzing the project codebase from a macro perspective, I've identified critical weak spots that need immediate attention to enable faster development and better maintainability.

## Current Issues Segmented by Type

### ðŸ”´ Critical Functional Issues
1. **Build Errors in Legacy Components** âœ… COMPLETED
   - ~~`DeepCleaningStep.tsx` and `MoveInOutStep.tsx` have TypeScript errors~~

   - ~~These are blocking the service-specific form separation~~

2. **Booking Form Architecture Complexity** âœ… COMPLETED
   - ~~Mixed usage of both legacy components and new service-specific forms~~
   - ~~Schema conflicts between different service types~~
   - ~~Inconsistent state management patterns~~

   - âœ… Proper loading and error states implemented

### âš¡ Code Optimization Opportunities
1. **Component Size Issues** âœ… COMPLETED

   - ~~Monolithic components that should be broken down~~
   - ~~Poor separation of concerns~~

2. **Performance Bottlenecks** âœ… COMPLETED
   - âœ… Implemented React.memo optimizations and memoized callbacks
   - âœ… Reduced unnecessary re-renders in booking forms
