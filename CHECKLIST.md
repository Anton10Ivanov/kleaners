## Mobile Optimization Strategy Applied

For each component we optimized, we applied these techniques:

1. **Used `useMediaQuery` hook** to detect mobile screens and conditionally render appropriate layouts
2. **Implemented responsive Tailwind classes** with mobile-first approach
3. **Adjusted spacing and typography** for better readability on small screens
4. **Enhanced touch targets** for better mobile interaction
5. **Created mobile-specific layouts** for complex components
6. **Improved loading states** for slower mobile connections
7. **Simplified navigation** for touch interfaces
8. **Optimized table views** with card-based layouts on mobile
9. **Fixed positioning** for important action buttons
10. **Reduced visual clutter** on smaller screens to focus on essential content
