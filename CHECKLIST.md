# Mobile Optimization Checklist

This document tracks the mobile optimization status of components in the application.

## ‚úÖ Optimized Components

## Strategy for Mobile Optimization

For each component requiring optimization, we will apply these techniques:

1. **Use `useMediaQuery` hook** to detect mobile screens
2. **Conditional rendering** for different layouts between mobile and desktop
3. **Mobile-first CSS** with tailwind responsive classes
4. **Layout restructuring** to prioritize important content on mobile
5. **Touch-friendly UI elements** with appropriate spacing
6. **Stack elements vertically** on mobile instead of using horizontal layouts
7. **Reduce padding and margins** on mobile screens
8. **Simplify navigation** for touch interfaces
