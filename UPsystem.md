## Technical Details To Implement

### Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- Enhance profiles with role-specific fields
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN user_type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'client';
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN provider_status TEXT;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN verification_level TEXT;

-- Create provider skills table
CREATE TABLE provider_skills (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  provider_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  skill TEXT NOT NULL,
  experience_years INTEGER,
  certification TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create provider service areas
CREATE TABLE provider_service_areas (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  provider_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  postal_code TEXT NOT NULL,
  travel_distance INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create provider availability
CREATE TABLE provider_availability (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  provider_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  day_of_week TEXT NOT NULL,
  start_time TIME NOT NULL,
  end_time TIME NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create unavailable dates for special occasions
CREATE TABLE provider_unavailable_dates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  provider_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  reason TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Update bookings to track provider assignments
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN assigned_provider_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id);
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN provider_accepted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

### Enhancements to Provider Registration

The "Join Our Team" page will be enhanced to serve as the entry point for service providers. The process will include:

1. Initial application form with personal information and cleaning skills
2. Background check authorization
3. Service area and availability setup
4. Skills and certifications documentation
5. Application status tracking 
6. Onboarding and training materials access

This flow will connect directly to the authentication system but place new accounts in a "pending verification" state until approved by administrators.

### Provider Dashboard Features

The provider dashboard will be the central hub for service providers, featuring:

1. Upcoming assignments with detailed information
2. Availability calendar management
3. Earnings tracking and payment history
4. Client reviews and feedback
5. Profile and skills management
6. Communication system for clients and administrators
