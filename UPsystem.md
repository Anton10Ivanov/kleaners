ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN provider_status TEXT;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN verification_level TEXT;

-- Create provider skills table
CREATE TABLE provider_skills (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  provider_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  skill TEXT NOT NULL,
  experience_years INTEGER,
  certification TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create provider service areas
CREATE TABLE provider_service_areas (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  provider_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create provider availability
