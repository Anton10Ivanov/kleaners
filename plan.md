# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Database Infrastructure (Completed)
- ✅ Create missing database tables for chat functionality
- ✅ Set up appropriate indexes for performance
- ✅ Implement RLS policies for data access control

## Phase 2: Code Optimization
- ✅ Update useConversationList hook to work with new database schema
- ✅ Optimize conversationUtils for better performance
- ✅ Update messageUtils to work with new database schema
- ✅ Improve useChat hook for real-time updates

## Phase 3: Performance Optimizations (Pending)
- [ ] Memoize expensive calculations in components
- [ ] Implement virtualization for message lists
- [ ] Add proper loading states to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Use React.memo for pure components

## Phase 4: Code Cleanup (Pending)
- [ ] Remove unused code and components
- [ ] Split large components into smaller, focused ones
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate functions
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries

## Phase 5: UI/UX Improvements (Pending)
- [ ] Optimize bundle size by code splitting
- [ ] Lazy load non-critical components
- [ ] Improve responsive design for mobile
- [ ] Add proper loading skeletons

## Phase 6: Testing & Monitoring (Pending)
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical functions
- [ ] Set up error monitoring
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for critical flows

## Identified Issues
1. Missing database tables for chat functionality
2. Performance bottlenecks in conversation listing
3. Redundant re-renders in chat components
4. No error handling for database operations
5. No real-time updates for chat messages
6. Large unoptimized components that should be split

## Progress
- Database schema has been implemented
- Core chat functionality now works with real database operations
- Real-time updates implemented for message notifications
