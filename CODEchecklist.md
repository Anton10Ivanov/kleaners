# Code Optimization Checklist

This document identifies areas where code optimization is needed to enhance performance, maintainability, and reliability.

## ‚úÖ Components To Optimize

### High Priority

1. **Long Component Files (Split into smaller components)**
   - ‚úÖ `src/pages/admin/AdminSettings.tsx` - Split into multiple tabs and settings sections
   - ‚úÖ `src/pages/user/UserProfile.tsx` - Broken down into smaller, focused components:
     - AvatarUploader.tsx
     - ProfileTabs.tsx
     - SecuritySettings.tsx
     - NotificationSettings.tsx
     - AccountPreferences.tsx
   - `src/pages/user/UserBookings.tsx` (223 lines) - Can be split into separate components for different sections
   - `src/pages/user/UserSettings.tsx` (297 lines) - Should be broken down into:
     - NotificationPreferencesCard.tsx
     - PasswordManagementCard.tsx
     - PrivacySecurityCard.tsx
     - DangerZoneCard.tsx
   - `src/pages/admin/AdminPanel.tsx` (234 lines) - Can be modularized further

2. **Complex Logic (Extract to custom hooks)**
   - `src/hooks/useUserBookings.ts` - Data transformation logic could be further optimized
   - `src/hooks/useUserProfileData.ts` - Can optimize error handling and state management
   - Create `useNotifications.ts` hook to manage notification preferences in UserSettings.tsx

3. **Render Optimization**
   - Add memo/useMemo for expensive calculations in booking components
   - Implement virtualization for long lists in admin sections
   - Use skeleton loaders more consistently for better loading states

### Medium Priority

1. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - Icons: Use lucide-react icons more consistently, avoid mixing icon libraries
   - Move to dynamic imports for large components like admin panels

2. **Network Optimization**
   - Implement caching for API calls with Tanstack Query
   - Optimize image loading with proper sizing and lazy loading

3. **Form Management**
   - Standardize form handling across all forms
   - Extract repeating form logic to custom hooks

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

### For Long Components

1. Extract logical sections into their own components
2. Apply single responsibility principle
3. Implement code splitting where appropriate

### For Complex Logic

1. Create specialized hooks for specific functionality
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Optimize state management with context where appropriate

### For Performance

1. Add React.memo() for components that don't need frequent re-rendering
2. Use proper key props in lists
3. Implement throttling/debouncing for search inputs and scrolling events

## üìä Performance Metrics to Monitor

- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Total Bundle Size
- Memory usage on mobile devices

## üîÑ Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for critical business logic
- Add performance tests to monitor regression
- Test on various mobile devices and slower networks

## Completed Tasks

1. ‚úÖ Optimized AdminSettings.tsx by breaking it down into tabs with focused content
2. ‚úÖ Implemented mobile-first approach across 5 components that were previously not optimized
3. ‚úÖ Added proper conditional rendering based on device size for improved performance
4. ‚úÖ Updated layout structures for all mobile views to ensure touch-friendly UI
5. ‚úÖ Refactored UserProfile.tsx into smaller components:
   - Created AvatarUploader component for profile picture management
   - Created ProfileTabs component to organize and manage tab navigation
   - Created SecuritySettings component for password and 2FA settings
   - Created NotificationSettings component for notification preferences
   - Created AccountPreferences component for account customization options
6. ‚úÖ Fixed TypeScript type errors in UserSidebar, ProfileTabs, and PersonalInfoForm components

## Next Tasks

1. Refactor UserBookings.tsx:
   - Create BookingCard component
   - Extract BookingList component
   - Implement BookingDetailsModal component

2. Optimize useUserBookings.ts hook:
   - Implement proper caching with React Query
   - Add error boundary handling
   - Optimize data transformation logic

3. Refactor AdminPanel.tsx:
   - Extract AdminHeader component
   - Create StatsSummary component
   - Create QuickActions component

## üö© Potential Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate/Similar Pages:**
   - `src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx` and `src/pages/admin/Dashboard.tsx` appear to serve similar purposes
   - `src/pages/user/UserDashboard.tsx` has significant overlap with `src/pages/user/UserBookings.tsx`

2. **Type Safety Issues:**
   - Several components using `any` types instead of proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Missing type definitions for form data in multiple components
   - Inconsistent prop type naming conventions

3. **Error Handling Gaps:**
   - `src/pages/user/UserSettings.tsx` has inadequate error handling for user deletion
   - Many async operations across components lack proper error boundaries
   - API error messages not consistently displayed to users

4. **Mobile Optimization Needed:**
   - `src/components/booking/Calendar.tsx` needs better mobile view
   - `src/components/admin/sections/bookings/BookingsTable.tsx` needs responsive design improvements
   - Multiple forms need better mobile keyboard handling

5. **State Management Issues:**
   - Excessive prop drilling in admin component hierarchy
   - Inconsistent usage of React Query vs. local state management
   - Multiple components managing overlapping state

6. **Performance Concerns:**
   - Large rendering trees in admin views causing potential performance issues
   - Unoptimized re-renders in list components
   - Image loading not optimized in service pages

7. **Code Structure Improvements:**
   - Inconsistent folder structure (some features in `/pages`, others in `/components`)
   - Utility functions duplicated across multiple files
   - Lack of standardized error handling pattern

8. **Authentication Flow:**
   - Inconsistent handling of unauthenticated states
   - Missing loader states during authentication checks
   - Potential security issues with user role validation

## üìã Technical Debt Tracking

1. **Refactoring Needed:**
   - Convert class components to functional components with hooks
   - Standardize form validation across the application
   - Create consistent data fetching pattern with React Query

2. **Documentation Gaps:**
   - Missing JSDoc comments on critical functions
   - Undocumented component props
   - Incomplete API interaction documentation

3. **Accessibility Issues:**
   - Missing ARIA attributes on interactive elements
   - Keyboard navigation gaps in complex components
   - Color contrast issues in some UI elements
