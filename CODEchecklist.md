# Code Optimization Checklist

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for optimizing and standardizing code across the entire application. When implementing these tasks:

1. **Apply changes systematically** across the whole codebase, not just in isolated files
2. **Test thoroughly** after each change to ensure functionality remains intact
3. **Document changes** made to track progress and ensure consistency
4. **Prioritize** tasks based on impact and dependency relationships

## ✅ Component Optimization

### High Priority

1. **Long Component Files**
   - ✅ `src/pages/admin/AdminSettings.tsx` - Split into multiple tabs and settings sections
   - ✅ `src/pages/user/UserProfile.tsx` - Broken down into smaller, focused components:
     - AvatarUploader.tsx
     - ProfileTabs.tsx
     - SecuritySettings.tsx
     - NotificationSettings.tsx
     - AccountPreferences.tsx
   - ✅ `src/pages/user/UserBookings.tsx` (223 lines) - Broken down into:
     - BookingCard.tsx
     - BookingList.tsx
     - BookingFilters.tsx
   - ✅ `src/pages/user/UserSettings.tsx` (297 lines) - Broken down into:
     - NotificationPreferencesCard.tsx
     - PasswordManagementCard.tsx
     - PrivacySecurityCard.tsx

## 🚩 Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

1. **Type Safety**
   - No use of `any` types except in exceptional cases
   - Create explicit interfaces for all data structures
   - Use union types instead of enums where appropriate
   - Add proper return types for all functions
   - Use generics for reusable components and hooks

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - PascalCase for React components, interfaces, and types
   - camelCase for variables, functions, and properties
   - PREFIX_UPPERCASE for constants
   - Use descriptive, intention-revealing names
   - Prefix interface names with 'I' only for component props (e.g., IButtonProps)

3. **Code Organization**
   - One component per file
   - Group related functionality in directories
   - Export components from index files for cleaner imports
   - Keep files under 200 lines of code
   - Extract complex logic to custom hooks

### React Best Practices

1. **Component Structure**
   - Use functional components with hooks
   - Extract repetitive JSX into smaller components
   - Keep components focused on a single responsibility
   - Use composition over inheritance
   - Implement React.memo for expensive components

2. **State Management**
   - Use local state for UI-only state
   - Leverage React Query for server state management
   - Avoid prop drilling with context where appropriate
   - Implement useReducer for complex state logic
   - Use Zod for type validation of API responses

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use React.memo for components that rarely change
   - Implement useMemo for expensive calculations
   - Apply useCallback for event handlers passed to child components
   - Use efficient list rendering techniques
   - Use code splitting for large component trees

### Testing Standards

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test each hook and utility function
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Focus on business logic and edge cases
   - Aim for >80% coverage of utility functions

2. **Component Tests**
   - Test component rendering
   - Verify component behavior with user interactions
   - Test accessibility features
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Mock API calls and context providers

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Test key user flows
   - Verify form submissions
   - Test navigation flows
   - Ensure data persistence works as expected
   - Verify app-wide state management

### Documentation Requirements

1. **Code Comments**
   - Add JSDoc comments to all functions, hooks, and components
   - Document props with descriptions and defaults
   - Explain complex algorithms and business logic
   - Add usage examples for reusable components
   - Document known limitations and edge cases

2. **API Documentation**
   - Document all API endpoints
