# Code Optimization Checklist

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for optimizing and standardizing code across the entire application. When implementing these tasks:

1. **Apply changes systematically** across the whole codebase, not just in isolated files
2. **Test thoroughly** after each change to ensure functionality remains intact
3. **Document changes** made to track progress and ensure consistency
4. **Prioritize** tasks based on impact and dependency relationships

## ✅ Component Optimization

### High Priority

1. **Long Component Files**
   - ✅ `src/pages/admin/AdminSettings.tsx` - Split into multiple tabs and settings sections
   - ✅ `src/pages/user/UserProfile.tsx` - Broken down into smaller, focused components:
     - AvatarUploader.tsx
     - ProfileTabs.tsx
     - SecuritySettings.tsx
     - NotificationSettings.tsx
     - AccountPreferences.tsx
   - ✅ `src/pages/user/UserBookings.tsx` (223 lines) - Broken down into:
     - BookingCard.tsx
     - BookingList.tsx
     - BookingFilters.tsx
   - ✅ `src/pages/user/UserSettings.tsx` (297 lines) - Broken down into:

## 🚩 Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

1. **Type Safety**
   - No use of `any` types except in exceptional cases
   - Create explicit interfaces for all data structures
   - Use union types instead of enums where appropriate
   - Add proper return types for all functions
   - Use generics for reusable components and hooks

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - PascalCase for React components, interfaces, and types
   - camelCase for variables, functions, and properties
   - PREFIX_UPPERCASE for constants
   - Use descriptive, intention-revealing names
   - Prefix interface names with 'I' only for component props (e.g., IButtonProps)

3. **Code Organization**
   - One component per file
   - Group related functionality in directories
   - Export components from index files for cleaner imports
   - Keep files under 200 lines of code
   - Extract complex logic to custom hooks

### React Best Practices

1. **Component Structure**
