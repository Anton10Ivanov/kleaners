# Code Optimization Checklist

This document identifies areas where code optimization is needed to enhance performance, maintainability, and reliability.

## ‚úÖ Components To Optimize

### High Priority

1. **Long Component Files (Split into smaller components)**
   - `src/pages/user/UserProfile.tsx` (389 lines) - Should be broken down into smaller, focused components
   - `src/pages/user/UserBookings.tsx` (223 lines) - Can be split into separate components for different sections
   - `src/pages/admin/AdminPanel.tsx` (234 lines) - Can be modularized further

2. **Complex Logic (Extract to custom hooks)**
   - `src/hooks/useUserBookings.ts` - Data transformation logic could be further optimized
   - `src/hooks/useUserProfileData.ts` - Can optimize error handling and state management

3. **Render Optimization**
   - Add memo/useMemo for expensive calculations in booking components
   - Implement virtualization for long lists in admin sections
   - Use skeleton loaders more consistently for better loading states

### Medium Priority

1. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - Icons: Use lucide-react icons more consistently, avoid mixing icon libraries
   - Move to dynamic imports for large components like admin panels

2. **Network Optimization**
   - Implement caching for API calls with Tanstack Query
   - Optimize image loading with proper sizing and lazy loading

3. **Form Management**
   - Standardize form handling across all forms
   - Extract repeating form logic to custom hooks

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

### For Long Components

1. Extract logical sections into their own components
2. Apply single responsibility principle
3. Implement code splitting where appropriate

### For Complex Logic

1. Create specialized hooks for specific functionality
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Optimize state management with context where appropriate

### For Performance

1. Add React.memo() for components that don't need frequent re-rendering
2. Use proper key props in lists
3. Implement throttling/debouncing for search inputs and scrolling events

## üìä Performance Metrics to Monitor

- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Total Bundle Size
- Memory usage on mobile devices

## üîÑ Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for critical business logic
- Add performance tests to monitor regression
- Test on various mobile devices and slower networks
