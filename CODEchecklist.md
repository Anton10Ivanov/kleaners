# Code Optimization Checklist

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for optimizing and standardizing code across the entire application. When implementing these tasks:

1. **Apply changes systematically** across the whole codebase, not just in isolated files
2. **Test thoroughly** after each change to ensure functionality remains intact
3. **Document changes** made to track progress and ensure consistency
4. **Prioritize** tasks based on impact and dependency relationships

## ✅ Component Optimization

### High Priority

1. **Long Component Files**
   - ✅ `src/pages/admin/AdminSettings.tsx` - Split into multiple tabs and settings sections
   - ✅ `src/pages/user/UserProfile.tsx` - Broken down into smaller, focused components:
     - AvatarUploader.tsx
     - ProfileTabs.tsx
     - SecuritySettings.tsx
     - NotificationSettings.tsx
     - AccountPreferences.tsx
   - ✅ `src/pages/user/UserBookings.tsx` (223 lines) - Broken down into:
     - BookingCard.tsx
     - BookingList.tsx
     - BookingFilters.tsx
   - ✅ `src/pages/user/UserSettings.tsx` (297 lines) - Broken down into:
     - NotificationPreferencesCard.tsx
     - PasswordManagementCard.tsx
     - PrivacySecurityCard.tsx
     - DangerZoneCard.tsx
   - ✅ `src/pages/admin/AdminPanel.tsx` (234 lines) - Split into:
     - AdminHeader.tsx
     - AdminStatsSummary.tsx
     - AdminQuickActions.tsx
   - ⏳ `src/hooks/useUserProfileData.ts` (237 lines) - Needs to be split into:
     - useProfileBasicInfo.ts - for handling name, email, phone data
     - useProfileAvatar.ts - for avatar operations
     - useProfileSecurity.ts - for password management
     - useProfilePreferences.ts - for notification and account preferences
     - useProfileDataUtils.ts - for shared utilities and types

2. **Complex Logic Extraction**
   - ✅ `src/hooks/useUserBookings.ts` - Refactored to use proper React Query patterns
   - ✅ `src/hooks/useUserProfileData.ts` - Fixed return type for changePassword function
   - ✅ Created reusable hooks for:
     - Form management (useFormWithValidation.ts)
     - API error handling (useApiQuery.ts)
     - Authentication state (useAuth.tsx)
     - Document title management (useTitle.ts)
   - ⏳ Implement custom hooks for:
     - Theme preferences (useTheme.tsx)
     - Media queries and responsive behavior (use-media-query.ts)

     - AdminHeader.tsx
     - AdminStatsSummary.tsx
     - AdminQuickActions.tsx
     - ProfileTabs.tsx
     - AvatarSection.tsx
   - ✅ Add useMemo/useCallback for expensive calculations and event handlers:
     - Action buttons array in AdminQuickActions.tsx
     - Stats cards array in AdminStatsSummary.tsx
     - Filtered bookings list in BookingList.tsx
   - ⏳ Implement virtualization for long lists in:
     - BookingsTable.tsx
     - CustomersTable.tsx
     - ProvidersTable.tsx

### Medium Priority

1. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - ⏳ Implement dynamic imports for:
     - AdminPanel and subcomponents
     - Calendar and booking components
     - Chart and statistics components
   - ⏳ Convert to lazy loading for routes

## 🚩 Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

1. **Type Safety**
   - No use of `any` types except in exceptional cases
   - Create explicit interfaces for all data structures
   - Use union types instead of enums where appropriate
   - Add proper return types for all functions
   - Use generics for reusable components and hooks

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - PascalCase for React components, interfaces, and types
   - camelCase for variables, functions, and properties
   - PREFIX_UPPERCASE for constants
   - Use descriptive, intention-revealing names
   - Prefix interface names with 'I' only for component props (e.g., IButtonProps)

3. **Code Organization**
   - One component per file
   - Group related functionality in directories
   - Export components from index files for cleaner imports
   - Keep files under 200 lines of code
   - Extract complex logic to custom hooks

### React Best Practices

1. **Component Structure**
   - Use functional components with hooks
   - Extract repetitive JSX into smaller components
   - Keep components focused on a single responsibility
   - Use composition over inheritance
