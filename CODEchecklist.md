# Code Optimization Checklist

This document identifies areas where code optimization is needed to enhance performance, maintainability, and reliability.

## ‚úÖ Components To Optimize

### High Priority

1. **Long Component Files (Split into smaller components)**
   - ‚úÖ `src/pages/admin/AdminSettings.tsx` - Split into multiple tabs and settings sections
   - ‚úÖ `src/pages/user/UserProfile.tsx` - Broken down into smaller, focused components:
     - AvatarUploader.tsx
     - ProfileTabs.tsx
     - SecuritySettings.tsx
     - NotificationSettings.tsx
     - AccountPreferences.tsx
   - `src/pages/user/UserBookings.tsx` (223 lines) - Can be split into separate components for different sections
   - `src/pages/admin/AdminPanel.tsx` (234 lines) - Can be modularized further

2. **Complex Logic (Extract to custom hooks)**
   - `src/hooks/useUserBookings.ts` - Data transformation logic could be further optimized
   - `src/hooks/useUserProfileData.ts` - Can optimize error handling and state management

3. **Render Optimization**
   - Add memo/useMemo for expensive calculations in booking components
   - Implement virtualization for long lists in admin sections
   - Use skeleton loaders more consistently for better loading states

### Medium Priority

1. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - Icons: Use lucide-react icons more consistently, avoid mixing icon libraries
   - Move to dynamic imports for large components like admin panels

2. **Network Optimization**
   - Implement caching for API calls with Tanstack Query
   - Optimize image loading with proper sizing and lazy loading

3. **Form Management**
   - Standardize form handling across all forms
   - Extract repeating form logic to custom hooks

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

### For Long Components

1. Extract logical sections into their own components
2. Apply single responsibility principle
3. Implement code splitting where appropriate

### For Complex Logic

1. Create specialized hooks for specific functionality
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Optimize state management with context where appropriate

### For Performance

1. Add React.memo() for components that don't need frequent re-rendering
2. Use proper key props in lists
3. Implement throttling/debouncing for search inputs and scrolling events

## üìä Performance Metrics to Monitor

- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Total Bundle Size
- Memory usage on mobile devices

## üîÑ Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for critical business logic
- Add performance tests to monitor regression
- Test on various mobile devices and slower networks

## Completed Tasks

1. ‚úÖ Optimized AdminSettings.tsx by breaking it down into tabs with focused content
2. ‚úÖ Implemented mobile-first approach across 5 components that were previously not optimized
3. ‚úÖ Added proper conditional rendering based on device size for improved performance
4. ‚úÖ Updated layout structures for all mobile views to ensure touch-friendly UI
5. ‚úÖ Refactored UserProfile.tsx into smaller components:
   - Created AvatarUploader component for profile picture management
   - Created ProfileTabs component to organize and manage tab navigation
   - Created SecuritySettings component for password and 2FA settings
   - Created NotificationSettings component for notification preferences
   - Created AccountPreferences component for account customization options

## Next Tasks

1. Refactor UserBookings.tsx:
   - Create BookingCard component
   - Extract BookingList component
   - Implement BookingDetailsModal component

2. Optimize useUserBookings.ts hook:
   - Implement proper caching with React Query
   - Add error boundary handling
   - Optimize data transformation logic

3. Refactor AdminPanel.tsx:
   - Extract AdminHeader component
   - Create StatsSummary component
   - Create QuickActions component
