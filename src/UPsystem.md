## Technical Details To Implement

### Payment Processing System

The payment processing system will integrate with Stripe to handle:

1. Client payment collection during booking
2. Automatic payment processing for recurring bookings
3. Provider earnings disbursement
4. Transaction history and receipt generation

```typescript
// Payment processing service
export class PaymentService {
  async processClientPayment(bookingId: string, amount: number, paymentMethodId: string) {
    // Process payment through Stripe
    // Update booking payment status
    // Generate receipt
  }
  
  async processProviderPayment(providerId: string, earnings: number) {
    // Calculate provider earnings after service fee
    // Transfer funds to provider account
    // Update earnings record
  }
}
```

### Service Quality Monitoring

The service quality monitoring system will:

1. Track client feedback and ratings
2. Monitor provider performance metrics
3. Generate quality reports for administrators
4. Trigger alerts for quality issues

```typescript
// Quality monitoring service
export class QualityService {
  async calculateProviderRating(providerId: string) {
    // Fetch all provider ratings
    // Calculate average rating
    // Update provider profile
  }
  
  async identifyQualityIssues() {
    // Identify providers with below-threshold ratings
    // Generate reports for administrators
    // Trigger notification system
  }
}
```

### Mobile Experience Optimization

The mobile optimization will focus on:

1. Responsive design for all provider dashboard views
2. Simplified job management interface for on-the-go updates
3. Push notifications for new job assignments
4. Geolocation features for service area proximity
