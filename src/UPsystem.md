## Technical Details To Implement

### Database Schema Finalization

```sql
-- Add earnings tracking for providers
CREATE TABLE provider_earnings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  provider_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  amount DECIMAL NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  payment_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Add notifications table
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  link TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Enhanced Provider-Client Interaction Flow

The provider-client interaction flow has been enhanced with the following features:

1. Providers can now view all available jobs in their service area
2. Clients can select preferred providers during booking
3. Providers receive job notifications and can accept/reject assignments
4. Upon job completion, clients can rate providers
5. Ratings affect provider visibility in search results

This bidirectional flow ensures both clients and providers have a streamlined experience with clear communication channels and expectations.
