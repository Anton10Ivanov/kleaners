## Technical Implementation Notes

The system has been restructured to provide a clear separation between client and provider experiences while maintaining a cohesive overall platform. Key technical considerations include:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions
   - Secure session management with proper token handling
   - Multi-factor authentication options for sensitive operations

2. **Data Model**
   - Normalized data structure with proper relationships
   - Efficient query patterns for common operations
   - Proper indexing for performance optimization

3. **User Experience**
   - Consistent UI/UX patterns across user types
   - Role-specific dashboards and navigation
   - Responsive design for all device types

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient data loading with pagination and lazy loading
   - Client-side caching for frequently accessed data
   - Background processing for intensive operations

5. **Security Measures**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities
   - Proper error handling and logging

The system now fully supports the entire lifecycle of both client and provider experiences, from onboarding through ongoing service delivery and relationship management.
