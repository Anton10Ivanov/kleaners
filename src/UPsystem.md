# User & Provider System Reconstruction Plan âœ…

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to restructure the application to clearly define and separate "User" (Client) and "Provider" (Service Provider) roles. The goal is to create a cohesive system where roles, permissions, and user flows are distinct while maintaining the existing admin functionality.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Payment Processing System

The payment processing system uses Stripe to handle all financial transactions:

```typescript
// Payment service architecture
interface PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount: number, paymentMethod: string): Promise<PaymentResult>;
  refundPayment(paymentId: string, amount?: number): Promise<RefundResult>;
  createSubscription(customerId: string, planId: string): Promise<SubscriptionResult>;
}

class StripePaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
  constructor(private apiKey: string) {}
  
  async processPayment(amount: number, paymentMethod: string): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    // Implementation using Stripe SDK
  }
  
  async refundPayment(paymentId: string, amount?: number): Promise<RefundResult> {
    // Implementation using Stripe SDK
  }
  
  async createSubscription(customerId: string, planId: string): Promise<SubscriptionResult> {
    // Implementation using Stripe SDK
  }
}

// Provider earnings service
class ProviderEarningsService {
  calculateEarnings(bookingId: string): Promise<number> {
    // Calculate provider earnings based on booking details and service fee
  }
  
  processPayouts(providerId: string, period: 'weekly' | 'biweekly' | 'monthly'): Promise<PayoutResult> {
    // Process payouts to providers based on completed jobs
  }
}
```

### Service Quality Monitoring System

The quality monitoring system tracks provider performance and client satisfaction:

```typescript
// Quality monitoring architecture
interface QualityMetric {
  providerId: string;
  metricName: string;
  value: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

class QualityMonitoringService {
  trackMetric(metric: QualityMetric): Promise<void> {
    // Store quality metric in database
  }
  
  calculateProviderScore(providerId: string): Promise<number> {
    // Calculate overall quality score for provider
  }
  
  identifyQualityIssues(): Promise<QualityIssue[]> {
    // Identify providers with quality issues
  }
  
  generateQualityReport(period: 'weekly' | 'monthly'): Promise<QualityReport> {
    // Generate quality report for specified period
  }
}

class NotificationService {
  notifyQualityIssue(issue: QualityIssue): Promise<void> {
    // Notify admin about quality issue
  }
  
  notifyProviderPerformance(providerId: string, score: number): Promise<void> {
    // Notify provider about their performance
  }
}
```

### Provider Mobile Optimization

The mobile optimization strategy focuses on creating a responsive and offline-capable experience:

```typescript
// Mobile optimization architecture
interface OfflineCapable {
  enableOfflineMode(): void;
  syncOfflineData(): Promise<void>;
}

class ProviderMobileApp implements OfflineCapable {
  private offlineData: Record<string, any> = {};
  
  enableOfflineMode(): void {
    // Cache essential data for offline use
  }
  
  async syncOfflineData(): Promise<void> {
    // Sync offline data with server when connection is restored
  }
  
  enablePushNotifications(deviceToken: string): Promise<void> {
    // Register device for push notifications
  }
  
  trackLocation(enabled: boolean): void {
    // Enable or disable location tracking
  }
  
  findNearbyJobs(radius: number): Promise<Job[]> {
    // Find jobs within specified radius
  }
}
```
