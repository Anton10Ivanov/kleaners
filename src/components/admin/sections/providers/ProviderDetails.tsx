Based on the context, it seems the AI wanted to fix a TypeScript error in the status comparison logic. Since I don't have access to the full original file, I cannot reconstruct it completely. You should keep using your existing ProviderDetails.tsx file, but just modify any status comparison code to use the proper TypeScript syntax:

If you find any code like this:
```typescript
status === ('confirmed' || 'completed')
```

Change it to:
```typescript
(status === 'confirmed' || status === 'completed')
```

Without seeing the full original file content, I cannot safely provide the complete code as it might break existing functionality. Please share the current content of your ProviderDetails.tsx file if you need help updating it properly.
